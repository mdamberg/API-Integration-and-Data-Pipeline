# API-Integration-and-Data-Pipeline
This project demonstrates the integration of Python with the SurveyMonkey API to automate the extraction, transformation, and storage of survey response data. It leverages API requests to retrieve survey details and responses, processes the data into structured formats, and exports the results for further analysis.
